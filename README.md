# Cry-To-Speak


## Problems Addressed:

Defining the needs of baby, with the help of his crying pitch and pattern👶</br>


## Overview:👓

Babies make lots of different noises from giggles to grunts to baby babble.</br>
Most of the time, they’re happily engrossed in their new world.</br>
When a need arises however, they have to let you know. </br>
According to Dunstan, there are five basic sounds your baby makes just before crying:</br>
Neh  – hunger</br>
Eh – upper wind (burp)</br>
Eairh – lower wind (gas)</br>
Heh – discomfort (hot, cold, wet)</br>
Owh – sleepiness</br>
</br>
It is sometimes over-exhausting and pontentially impossible to detect the reason for which baby started crying, especially when the monther is not around.</br>
It is to such situations that this project comes to rescue.</br>
</br>
We will be exploiting the above stated data and be making an a system to inform the parents about their cutie’s need.</br>
This will be an extremely heplful way to talk to your child in his way(and will reduca a lot of noise pollution).</br>
We will only be providing the customer a cloth with small and harmless embedded sensors and a mobile app.</br>

## Goals: 🎡

1 - To give words to voice of babies and rest to headache of parents.</br>
2 - To give peace to neighbours ears 😜</br>

## Scalability (targeted category of people that will benefit from this):

Everyone who is born within a year, to the ones who gave birth to them and to the ones living around them.</br>

## Tech Stacks Required:

1 -Hardware</br>
2 -ML</br>
3 -Android</br>

## Limitations:
 
1- Dataset will be tricky to find, as it requires a huge dataset.</br>

## Roadmap Overview:

First time interval - 3 months  - A working model with hardware basics ready. ⏳

Second time interval - 2 months - complete project with the cloth and app ready⌛ 

## Approximate count of contributors required: 
  
  `5-6 People.` 👨🧑👩👧👦🧒
  
  
 # Let's Get Creating !!👍
