# Cry-To-Speak


## Problems Addressed:

Defining the needs of baby, with the help of his crying pitch and pattern👶


## Overview:👓

Babies make lots of different noises from giggles to grunts to baby babble.
Most of the time, they’re happily engrossed in their new world.
When a need arises however, they have to let you know. 
According to Dunstan, there are five basic sounds your baby makes just before crying:
Neh  – hunger
Eh – upper wind (burp)
Eairh – lower wind (gas)
Heh – discomfort (hot, cold, wet)
Owh – sleepiness

It is sometimes over-exhausting and pontentially impossible to detect the reason for which baby started crying, especially when the monther is not around.
It is to such situations that this project comes to rescue.

We will be exploiting the above stated data and be making an a system to inform the parents about their cutie’s need.
This will be an extremely heplful way to talk to your child in his way(and will reduca a lot of noise pollution).
We will only be providing the customer a cloth with small and harmless embedded sensors and a mobile app.

## Goals: 🎡

1 - To give words to voice of babies and rest to headache of parents.
2 - To give peace to neighbours ears 😜

## Scalability (targeted category of people that will benefit from this):

Everyone who is born within a year, to the ones who gave birth to them and to the ones living around them.

## Tech Stacks Required:

1 -Hardware
2 -ML
3 -Android

## Limitations:
 
1- Dataset will be tricky to find, as it requires a huge dataset.

## Roadmap Overview:

First time interval - 3 months  - A working model with hardware basics ready. ⏳

Second time interval - 2 months - complete project with the cloth and app ready⌛ 

## Approximate count of contributors required: 
  
  `5-6 People.` 👨🧑👩👧👦🧒
  
  
 # Let's Get Creating !!👍
